# UNDEATH

#### Let the beast know no mercy,
#### for such a thing it does not comprehend.
#### Let it taste pain, its blood pouring forth,
#### for only death shall be their end.
<br/>

#### Let no foul demon ever live,
#### for such a thing it has no right.
#### Let its very existence be undone,
#### for upon this land it is a blight.
<br/>

#### Let your blade guide your way,
#### let your magic light your path.
#### Let your gun strike the heart,
#### let your hands rend them apart.
<br/>

#### For the sins of them all,
#### for the folly of their kind.
#### May they all rue their traitorous act,
#### may they regret taking our promised land.

### So... What is this even supposed to be?

**UNDEATH** is a gameplay mod for **GZDoom** where you take on the role of a lone warrior of the **Anarukon** people, tasked with the mission of slaying the demon hordes of **Hell**.

Endless, immortal... For you death is merely a temporary setback, so as you can imagine, this is pretty much a mod where you really just can't lose... Or is it?

At the moment, there's not much else to say about this mod, only scattered ideas exist for now, but it will all begin to take some form once focus is shifted from other projects in progress, so stay tuned.
