## So... What is this even supposed to be?

**UNDEATH** is a standalone title for **GZDoom** where you take on the role of a warrior of the **Anarukon** people, tasked with the mission of slaying the demon hordes of **Hell**.

Endless, immortal... For you death is merely a temporary setback, so as you can imagine, you really can't lose... Or can you?

At the moment, there's very little to say about this, only scattered ideas exist for now, but it will all begin to take some form once focus is shifted from other projects in progress, so stay tuned.

## The Story

It is the year 2165 in the human calendar. Their world has been ravaged, many of their kind have fallen since the first incursions, but others have taken a step in fighting back, repelling the demonic forces. Among them was the legendary **Doom Marine**, a soldier of the **UAC**, the greedy, power hungry human-led organization that caused this whole incident to take place. But there was also the heroic **Demolitionist**, a machine of war constructed by a human that is rumored to have immortal blood.

Together, these two managed to strike fear into the hearts of the demons, but this isn't enough. The corruption still lies at the very heart of **Hell**, the **Archdemon Generals**, the traitors who overthrew the **Kuriste Royal Family**, shattering all ties to the **Anarukon Free Communities**, they still remain in power.

Your objective, warrior, is to end the lives of each and every one of them.

## The Characters

There are a number of characters you can choose at the start of a new game, each with different specialties and stats. Whichever you choose of each group to play as, the others will become NPCs you can interact with throughout the game.

### Disciples of Veryakhai

Three brave warriors, bonded by their many adventures together. All trained under the great master **Nussana Veryakhai**, herself also a former apprentice of the legendary **Arkon Skhxheenzh**, hero of the **Anarukon**.

#### Sada Eryanai

![portrait](docimg/sada.png)

Specialized in melee combat, she knows how to most efficiently employ the strongest of bladed weapons. Her skills with magic are focused on pyromancy. Due to her large stature, she may have trouble moving around, but this is complemented with much heftier resistances, basically making her the tank option.

#### Zorou Sokana

![portrait](docimg/zorou.png)

Specialized in firearm combat, he's quite an expert with all sorts of guns, including some not of **Anarukon** manufacture. Certainly, he may be able to employ some rather unconventional weaponry too, if he's lucky enough to find some. His magic abilities are mostly focused on restoration and defensive spells. Out of all three he's the swiftest, but he's not very good with close combat.

#### Nyakko Oryusae

![portrait](docimg/nyakko.png)

Specialized in magic, they are well-versed in many different schools, allowing them to perform some of the most powerful spells known. From all forms of elemental magic, to even harnessing time manipulation, nothing escapes them. They're the weakest physically, but this is compensated by a much larger mana pool. Their small frame allows for better mobility, too, but limits the kinds of conventional weapons they may be able to use.

### Children of the Witch of London (DLC)

These three siblings are no strangers to battle, and you may one day bear witness to their outstanding abilities.

#### Adrian Knox

The middle child, who has taken part in two of the fiercest wars the human world has ever seen, earning the title of **The Unkillable Britishman**. His strength is quite noteworthy, and he is quite proficient with the blade, along with hand to hand combat. Any magic skills, however, are nowhere to be seen with him.

#### Ashley Knox

The eldest child, the so-called **Stylish Witch of the West**. She is an expert with heavy firearms, as well as having excellent skills in alchemy and spellcasting. In addition, she can do all this while still looking as beautiful and stylish as ever.

#### Viola Knox

The youngest child, and self-proclaimed **Witch of Cats**. Master of summoning, her endless armies of fierce felines can trash even the mightiest foes in a matter of seconds. Her rather unorthodox clothing in addition allows her not just to have amplified spellcasting, but also grants great mobility.

## Gameplay

As in any Souls-like (though this is more of a Souls-lite), there are three things to mainly keep track of: Your **Health**, **Stamina** and **Mana**.

- **Health** slowly regenerates over time, but it can also be recovered by using various healing items and spells, as well as resting at certain safe zones. Food can also help boost regeneration.
- **Stamina** is recovered when idle. Simply stop moving or attacking and it'll refill on its own. There are also certain items that can make this recovery faster.
- **Mana** can be recovered with rest, certain foods, and potions that stimulate mana absorption. It is a natural energy gathered from the environment, but there are rich sources of it that can be tapped into.

Of course, there's also the matter of your weaponry, spells, ammunition, and various items you can employ. These will be detailed later.

### Death and Blood

You are **Anarukon**. To you, death is merely a temporary setback, as you can simply come back to life later on once your body has repaired itself. There are, however, certain conditions that might make this harder, or even outright impossible, and they are related to your blood.

The body of the undying requires blood to heal itself, blood brimming with iron and essential nutrients. A lack of these causes the body's healing abilities to wane, and with time, would drive the individual into a maddening thirst for blood if not treated.

Of course, you can keep yourself healthy by eating and drinking when needed, but there are also other methods by which you can enrich your blood, one of them being the valuable, but rare **Akashna Extract**: A nutritious beverage concocted with the fresh blood of a healthy **Akashna**. Do note however that the very thick stench of blood may attract unwanted attention when opened.

Thinning of the blood, if untreated, will eventually result in the inability to regenerate, meaning you will no longer be able to fight, and your body will remain dead. In this case, not all is truly lost, as your immortal soul can force the body to scatter, allowing it to reform in a safer place and giving a chance for your companions to tend to your health.

### The Hub

Your missions will take you all around various locales within Hell, but there will always be a hub where you can take a break, have a chat with your comrades, trade goods, have lunch, enjoy a bath together, get some sleep...

While this safe haven may seem a bit small with just you and your squad around, do keep in mind that sometimes certain individuals you encounter throughout your adventures may stop by for a visit. Some might even stay and help around, set up shop, and so on. Despite the current forces in power, it's not like the civilian population rejects your kind.

### Missions

Most of your assassination jobs can be tackled in any order. In some cases, a bit of surveying ahead of time might also be helpful. Things are generally open ended as you make your way towards each target, and ultimately, to the very innermost part of Hell's capital city and the *"big shot"* at the top of the list. You may sometimes find a path locked, in which case you should probably keep it marked for later, as whatever you may need for it to open could be found elsewhere.

Some side missions might also open up by request of certain people you'll come across. These offer some juicy rewards that might prove useful along the way. Nevertheless, they are optional, so you can freely choose whether or not to do them.

### Bonding

Spending time with your companions is always a nice thing. Not only can you hang out with them in the hub, but you can also ask them to come along with you for your missions, should you find yourself shorthanded. Having friends around also allows you to share items. Just remember one thing: They also need the stuff, don't be greedy.

### Equipment

While each character has a set of starting items and weaponry, more can be found out in the field if one knows where to look, and some merchants might even sell you their wares in exchange for **Crystallized Ardent**, which can be obtained as you slay demons.

One important detail to keep in mind about this **Crystallized Ardent**, however, is that should you die and scatter yourself, any of it you're holding will be lost, as the process causes it to return to its natural state and dissipate into the air. It is not lost forever, though, as any enemies nearby might absorb it in their bodies, often raising from the dead in the process, allowing you to recover it as you slay them again.

## The Hit List

Your mission is to slay the nine archdemon generals responsible for the coup of 2145, each and every single one of them, without exception. Whatever they may try to get away, you must bring swift death to them.

1. **Berias Ysharan**, the **Lustful Malefactor**
2. **Destora Arathon**, the **Blood Dancer**
3. **Urthura Vexamal**, the **Beacon of Scorn**
4. **Gyeran Rashaz**, the **Flesh Servant**
5. **Vera Akerastora**, the **Scion of Gluttony**
6. **Kaume Irishtanar**, the **Lord of Deceit**
7. **Taeron Yraisamal**, the **Betrayer of Faith**
8. **Thaar Adarion**, the **Despot Knight**
9. **Erebus Arthamuz**, the **Grand General**

If possible, you may also attempt to locate **Akedas Aximal**, the right hand man and personal advisor of the leading general, and dispose of him too. No one knows of his actual hiding place since the onslaught of the human soldier and the heroic machine, so it may be necessary to conduct a thorough investigation.
