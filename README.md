## So... What is this even supposed to be?

**UNDEATH** is a standalone title for **GZDoom** where you take on the role of a warrior of the **Anarukon** people, tasked with the mission of slaying the demon hordes of **Hell**.

Endless, immortal... For you death is merely a temporary setback, so as you can imagine, you really can't lose... Or can you?

At the moment, there's very little to say about this, only scattered ideas exist for now, but it will all begin to take some form once focus is shifted from other projects in progress, so stay tuned.

## The Story

It is the year 2165 in the human calendar. Their world has been ravaged, many of their kind have fallen since the first incursions, but others have taken a step in fighting back, repelling the demonic forces. Many fought to push them back, some earning their fame as heroes in the process. Together, they put a stop to the invasion, and **Earth** was once again saved from impending doom.

But alas, this was not enough, as corruption still lies at the very heart of **Hell** itself: The **Archdemon Generals**, the traitors who overthrew the **Kuriste Royal Family**, shattering all ties to the **Anarukon Free Communities**, they still remain in power.

Your objective, warrior, is to end the lives of each and every one of them. As a **Disciple of Veryakhai**, it is your mission to fight for the liberation of the olden realm of **Kur**, wresting it from the hands of the demons who stole it away.

## The Hit List

Your mission is to slay the nine archdemon generals responsible for the coup of 2145, each and every single one of them, without exception. Whatever they may try to get away, you must bring swift death to them.

1. **Berias Ysharan**, the **Lustful Malefactor**
2. **Destora Arathon**, the **Blood Dancer**
3. **Urthura Vexamal**, the **Beacon of Scorn**
4. **Gyeran Rashaz**, the **Flesh Servant**
5. **Vera Akerastora**, the **Scion of Gluttony**
6. **Kaume Irishtanar**, the **Lord of Deceit**
7. **Taeron Yraisamal**, the **Betrayer of Faith**
8. **Thaar Adarion**, the **Despot Knight**
9. **Erebus Arthamuz**, the **Decadent Conqueror**

If possible, you may also attempt to locate **Akedas Aximal**, the right hand man and personal advisor of the leading general, and dispose of him too. No one knows of his actual hiding place since the onslaught of the human soldier and the heroic machine, so it may be necessary to conduct a thorough investigation.

## The Characters

There are a number of characters you can choose at the start of a new game, each with different specialties and stats. Whichever you choose of each group to play as, the others will become NPCs you can interact with throughout the game.

### Disciples of Veryakhai

Three brave warriors, bonded by their many adventures together. All trained under the great master **Nussana Veryakhai**, herself also a former apprentice of the legendary **Arkon Skhxheenzh**, hero of the **Anarukon**.

#### Sada Eryanai

![portrait](docimg/sada.png)

Specialized in melee combat, she knows how to most efficiently employ the strongest of bladed weapons. Her skills with magic are focused on pyromancy. Due to her large stature, she may have trouble moving around, but this is complemented with much heftier resistances, basically making her the tank option.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **Pronoxyte Claymore:** A large blade of hard metal, normally wielded with both hands, but **Sada** has no trouble using it one-handed. Like pretty much all **Anarukon** melee weapons it is made of **Pronoxyte**, a strong, hard metal that is also employed in electronics due to its high conductivity and heat resistance. In contact with an open wound, it causes a numbing effect, leaving foes in the dark about the fact they've been cut down and are bleeding out, although usually, with a weapon this large, they'll be quick to notice their whole body has been cleaved in half.
 - **Nelaka Xei PDW:** A popular submachine gun from the great imperial **Nelaka Arms Company**, employing caseless 5mm ammunition fired through a magic-based mechanism. Quite handy for dealing with targets that are too far for one to swing a blade at.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **Ember Flash:** A small burst of fire from one's open palm. Semi-short range, and more damaging the closer one is to the target.
 - **Eruption:** A staple of the *"explosion magic"* sub-school of pyromancy. Focusing on a single nearby spot, a potent blast will be triggered, sending nearby targets flying into the air, covered in flames.
 - **Stone Skin:** A defensive spell that temporarily coats the wearer's skin with stony scales, improving resistance at the cost of decreased mobility.
 - **Red Sun:** One of the many revolutionary spells of the **Beast-Magus**. A raging inferno conjured into a self-stabilized sphere, ready to be thrown into the face of whoever is unlucky to deserve such a nasty surprise.
 - **Inferno Whirl:** A potent area denial pyromancy, summoning a conjunction of flame whirls that dance around the caster, spreading outwards in the process.

#### Zorou Sokana

![portrait](docimg/zorou.png)

Specialized in firearm combat, he's quite an expert with all sorts of guns, including some not of **Anarukon** manufacture. Certainly, he may be able to employ some rather unconventional weaponry too, if he's lucky enough to find some. His magic abilities are mostly focused on restoration and defensive spells. Out of all three he's the swiftest, but he's not very good with close combat.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **Sokana Long Auto-Rifle:** One of the weapons he personally built. Useful both for heated close to mid range firefights and also for long range sniping. 6.7mm caseless, 40-round box magazine, with both semi and full auto modes. Comes with a bayonet attachment, should you be in a hurry to deal with foes getting a bit too close for comfort.
 - **2x Pronoxyte Dagger:** Two blades are better than one. Kept nicely in Zorou's garters for quick access, these deadly blades will make anyone wishing to get too close and personal regret their choice.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **Heal:** A simple spell to close wounds and regain vitality, if only a little. Immediately stops any bleeding and regains some lost health. If you're currently looking at a companion, you will cast it on them, rather than yourself.
 - **Cure Poison:** A simple spell to purge toxins from the body. Has the unfortunate consequence of also eliminating any buffs one may get from consuming alcoholic drinks. Can also be casted on companions. Very potent toxic effects require a charged cast to fully heal.
 - **Barrier:** Generates a temporary blockade in front of you. Useful to gain some cover when there isn't any around.
 - **Grand Cross:** A potent anti-demon spell, especially effective against those with a large concentration of **Ardent Energy** in their bodies (that is, the spell becomes more effective the stronger the foe is). Archdemons, however, appear to have a natural resistance against it.
 - **Retribution:** A somewhat twisted spell that, for a limited time, returns to attackers three to nine times the amount of damage they may deal to you, depending on charge. Its usefulness tends to be very situational, as it does require the user to intentionally put themselves in harm's way.

#### Nyakko Oryusae

![portrait](docimg/nyakko.png)

Specialized in magic, they are well-versed in many different schools, allowing them to perform some of the most powerful spells known. From all forms of elemental magic, to even harnessing time manipulation, nothing escapes them. They're the weakest physically, but this is compensated by a much larger mana pool. Their small frame allows for better mobility, too, but limits the kinds of conventional weapons they may be able to use. In addition, they do know some very potent spells, which they've mastered and refined over the span of decades, however, they can't be bothered to learn any new spells, so those are all they have.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **N/A:** They don't particularly see any usefulness in weaponry, so all you'll have as a fallback is raw hand-to-hand combat.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **God Slash:** A potent spell that cleaves through anything. Sharper than any blade, it can quickly dispose of large groups of enemies at a short range. Useful to clear a path when surrounded.
 - **Dark Entanglement:** Thorns of dark energy that coil around enemies, bleeding them dry.
 - **Damnation:** A potent burst of cursed energy. Leaves clouds of blackened smoke that sap life away from anything they touch.
 - **Unearthed Magic:** A pillar of blue flame springs forth and bathes everything around it in magic fire until it hits a wall.
 - **Master Flare:** A lethal blast of wild magic, comparable to a miniature star in potency.
 - **Monarch's Wrath:** A defensive *"personal space cleanser"*, releasing a geyser of scorching plasma that pushes away all nearby targets, while preventing any harm to the caster.
 - **Chronic Halt:** One of the most difficult chronomantic spells. Causes targets to be trapped in stasis for several seconds, halting all their motions. Ineffective on larger targets unless charged.

## Gameplay

As in any Souls-like (though this is more of a Souls-lite), there are three things to mainly keep track of: Your **Health**, **Stamina** and **Mana**.

- **Health** slowly regenerates over time, but it can also be recovered by using various healing items and spells, as well as resting at certain safe zones. Food can also help boost regeneration. Your health drains as you take damage, and when it's all out, you die, simple as that.
- **Stamina** is recovered when idle. Simply stop moving or attacking and it'll refill on its own. There are also certain items that can make this recovery faster. Stamina is consumed by strenuous acts, such as dashing and dodging, melee attacks, firing guns, and casting certain spells. When it runs out, you'll be out of breath for a while, leaving you helpless against enemy attack.
- **Mana** can be recovered with rest, certain foods, and potions that stimulate mana absorption. It is a natural energy gathered from the environment, but there are rich sources of it that can be tapped into. Mana is consumed when casting spells, and is also necessary for operating **Anarukon** firearms, as they require a mana charge for round ignition.

Of course, there's also the matter of your weaponry, spells, ammunition, and various items you can employ. These will be detailed later.

### Death and Blood

You are **Anarukon**. To you, death is merely a temporary setback, as you can simply come back to life later on once your body has repaired itself. There are, however, certain conditions that might make this harder, or even outright impossible, and they are related to your blood.

The body of the undying requires blood to heal itself, blood brimming with iron and essential nutrients. A lack of these causes the body's healing abilities to wane, and with time, would drive the individual into a maddening thirst for blood if not treated.

Of course, you can keep yourself healthy by eating and drinking when needed, but there are also other methods by which you can enrich your blood, one of them being the valuable, but rare **Akashna Extract**: A nutritious beverage concocted with the fresh blood of a healthy **Akashna**. Do note however that the very thick stench of blood may attract unwanted attention when opened.

Thinning of the blood, if untreated, will eventually result in the inability to regenerate, meaning you will no longer be able to fight, and your body will remain dead. In this case, not all is truly lost, as your immortal soul can force the body to scatter, allowing it to reform in a safer place and giving a chance for your companions to tend to your health.

### The Hub

Your missions will take you all around various locales within Hell, but there will always be a hub where you can take a break, have a chat with your comrades, trade goods, have lunch, enjoy a bath together, get some sleep...

While this safe haven may seem a bit small with just you and your squad around, do keep in mind that sometimes certain individuals you encounter throughout your adventures may stop by for a visit. Some might even stay and help around, set up shop, and so on. Despite the current forces in power, it's not like the civilian population rejects your kind.

### Missions

Most of your assassination jobs can be tackled in any order. In some cases, a bit of surveying ahead of time might also be helpful. Things are generally open ended as you make your way towards each target, and ultimately, to the very innermost part of **Hell**'s capital city and the *"big shot"* at the top of the list. You may sometimes find a path locked, in which case you should probably keep it marked for later, as whatever you may need for it to open could be found elsewhere.

Some side missions might also open up by request of certain people you'll come across. These offer some juicy rewards that might prove useful along the way. Nevertheless, they are optional, so you can freely choose whether or not to do them.

### The World Map

Upon leaving an area, rather than have to deal with several kilometers of travel on foot to the next one, you will be sent to the world map, where you can quickly move to other places you've unlocked. Each new exit you find from one area will open a new path to another. Make sure to explore thoroughly so you may find easy routes to all the various corners of Hell and make your journey throughout much easier.

### Bonding

Spending time with your companions is always a nice thing. Not only can you hang out with them in the hub, but you can also ask them to come along with you for your missions, should you find yourself shorthanded. Having friends around also allows you to share items. Just remember one thing: They also need the stuff, don't be greedy.

## Equipment

While each character has a set of starting items and weaponry, more can be found out in the field if one knows where to look, and some merchants might even sell you their wares in exchange for **Crystallized Ardent**, which can be obtained as you slay demons.

One important detail to keep in mind about this **Crystallized Ardent**, however, is that should you die and scatter yourself, any of it you're holding will be lost, as the process causes it to return to its natural state and dissipate into the air. It is not lost forever, though, as any enemies nearby might absorb it in their bodies, often raising from the dead and allowing you to recover it as you slay them again.

### Spells

The very deity that created magic billions of years ago is often quoted with saying *"anyone with a soul can cast magic, but only those with a loving heart can truly **USE** it"*. Magic is as ubiquitous in the daily lives of the **Anarukon** as is technology, serving as yet another tool at their disposal to make things easier. On the field, each character has a lineup of spells they can employ, each consuming a certain amount of mana in the process. Still, more spells can be obtained during the mission, if you can find someone or something to learn them from, and they belong to the school you specialize in.

Spells are equipped as would be weapons, wherein primary fire would perform a straight cast, while secondary fire would allow you to charge up a stronger version of the spell. Up to seven spells can be attuned at the same time, taking up slots 4 through 0.

### Weapons

Since your bare hands aren't usually enough, weapons are of course quite important to have too. Melee weapons are the simplest to use, with primary fire being employed for quick, weaker attacks and secondary for slower, stronger swings. Firearms, on the other hand, require ammunition (and in some cases mana), which can generally be found scattered on the field or purchased from merchants. In certain cases, it's also possible to craft ammunition from raw materials (easy for **Anarukon** weaponry, as they're simple metal projectiles, but more complicated for other weapons, such as those of human manufacture). Firearms are operated with primary fire, while secondary allows you to use their sights for more precise aiming.

Two weapons can be carried at the same time, assigned to slots 2 and 3. Slot 1 allows you to fall back to simple hand-to-hand melee at any moment, should you wish to.

## DLC Episode: A Witch's Demon Hunt

Potential for an expansion is definitely there once the main game is done. This might or might not be done depending on the circumstances. A glimpse of what would be offered will be shown here.

### The Story

June of 2148, the **Demon Invasion** has reached its peak. Countless brave heroes are out there fighting back, repelling the invading forces. Of course, here in **Southern Ireland**, things couldn't be any worse. The rather incompetent local military hasn't been able to do much, and the government, in an unexpected turn, has decided to put its faith in the **Anarukon** population of their various cities. Warriors, witches, and many others have answered this call, seeing this as a chance to finally offer the nation who once treated them like monsters a very big slice of humble pie.

### Rough Outline

This one will be a bit more linear, I feel. A more traditional central hub with unlockable maps around it, or perhaps multiple hubs. Yeah, starting to sound Hexen-ish there, I think... The point is to explore various locations and their surroundings, obtaining key items that will allow you progress deeper and deeper into the epicenter of the London invasion. Each hub will end with a boss encounter, before proceeding to the next, until reaching the "final boss". All of this has yet to be decided, of course. It'd be best to leave it be until the base game is actually done.

### Children of the Witch of London

These three siblings are no strangers to battle, and you shall bear witness to their outstanding abilities.

#### Adrian Knox

The middle child, who has taken part in two of the fiercest wars the human world has ever seen, earning the title of **The Unkillable Britishman**. His strength is quite noteworthy, and he is quite proficient with the blade, along with hand to hand combat. Any magic skills, however, are nowhere to be seen with him, and he has no interest in learning.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **Machete:** A perfect instrument to cleave through the thick flesh of hellspawn. Built with high quality carbon steel, and sawed for extra cutting action.
 - **Boskin 1811:** A popular WW2 handgun, and a mainstay of **Adrian**'s collection as a memento of his time in the war. Chambered for .45 AVP, it's got some power for sure.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **N/A:** Again, he has no intention of using magic.

#### Ashley Knox

The eldest child, the so-called **Stylish Witch of the West**. She is an expert with heavy firearms, as well as having excellent skills in alchemy and spellcasting. In addition, she can do all this while still looking as beautiful and stylish as ever.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **2x "Witch's Bride" Shotgun:** Once part of the personal collection of a former witch hunter, these two happily married lever-action shotguns have been rebranded by **Ashley** herself. Not that the owner would mind, as he's long since dead and buried... By her own hand. The shells fed into each of them are charged with potent fire and ice magic.
 - **Garrett M84 "Patriarch":** The all-popular beefy .50 OMG sniper rifle that everyone loves. Even the sound of it being fired is enough to strike fear in the enemy. Part of **Ashley**'s personal collection, usually kept in a neat display case in her bedroom. It definitely has seen some action, but she makes sure to keep it in mint condition. Unlike typical commercial models, this one has been modified for left-handed use.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **Crimson Shard:** Puncturing shards of red gemstone with a poisonous effect.
 - **Zalya's Fire:** A form of wild pyromancy that not many can truly master. Call forth acidic flames that burn up targets from the inside.
 - **Cryotic Blast:** A basic cryomantic spell, but don't let that deceive you. **Ashley** has perfected her understanding of its potential to a point where she can easily unleash a deadly blast of gelid air capable of freezing targets in a wide range.
 - **Dark Edge:** Dark magic is generally unpopular due to its difficulty, and the potential detriments to one's perception by the public. This despite the fact it is one of the purest forms of spellcasting, and even one that the very deity that created magic is most fond of. A thin jet of cutting force that is said to practically split atoms in half. On impact, rather than actually cutting targets, it appears to cause a release of scalding plasma wherever it touches.
 - **Pale Wrath:** Unleashes a concentrated pulse of incandescent plasma, mowing down everything on its path.

#### Viola Knox

The youngest child, and self-proclaimed **Witch of Cats**. Master of summoning, her endless armies of fierce felines can trash even the mightiest foes in a matter of seconds. Her rather unorthodox clothing in addition allows her not just to have amplified spellcasting, but also grants great mobility.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **Z4 Casalli:** A supposedly cursed revolver. **Viola**'s skills with incantation allow her to imbue bullets with a soul-seeking capability, letting them steer towards nearby foes.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **Umbral Spear:** Summons a piercing spear of darkness that impales targets with extreme prejudice.
 - **Umbral Catalyst:** Summons bombs of darkness that blast targets to bits in a wide area.
 - **Umbral Cloak:** Summons a mantle of darkness that saps life and mana from targets.
 - **Umbral Stampede:** Calls forth a swarm of spectral cats, which will claw and bite targets to death.
