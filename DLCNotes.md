## DLC Episode: A Witch's Demon Hunt

Potential for an expansion is definitely there once the main game is done. This might or might not be done depending on the circumstances. A glimpse of what would be offered will be shown here.

### The Story

June of 2148, the **Demon Invasion** has reached its peak. Countless brave heroes are out there fighting back, repelling the invading forces. Of course, here in **Southern Ireland**, things couldn't be any worse. The rather incompetent local military hasn't been able to do much, and the government, in an unexpected turn, has decided to put its faith in the **Anarukon** population of their various cities. Warriors, witches, and many others have answered this call, seeing this as a chance to finally offer the nation who once treated them like monsters a very big slice of humble pie.

### Rough Outline

This one will be a bit more linear, I feel. A more traditional central hub with unlockable maps around it, or perhaps multiple hubs. Yeah, starting to sound Hexen-ish there, I think... The point is to explore various locations and their surroundings, obtaining key items that will allow you progress deeper and deeper into the epicenter of the London invasion. Each hub will end with a boss encounter, before proceeding to the next, until reaching the "final boss". All of this has yet to be decided, of course. It'd be best to leave it be until the base game is actually done.

### Children of the Witch of London

These three siblings are no strangers to battle, and you shall bear witness to their outstanding abilities.

#### Adrian Knox

The middle child, who has taken part in two of the fiercest wars the human world has ever seen, earning the title of **The Unkillable Britishman**. His strength is quite noteworthy, and he is quite proficient with the blade, along with hand to hand combat. Any magic skills, however, are nowhere to be seen with him, and he has no interest in learning. To compensate, he's capable of carrying a whole arsenal with him, becoming a one-man army.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **Machete:** A perfect instrument to cleave through the thick flesh of hellspawn. Built with high quality carbon steel, and sawed for extra cutting action.
 - **Boskin 1811:** A popular WW2 handgun, and a mainstay of **Adrian**'s collection as a memento of his time in the war. Chambered for .45 AVP, it's got some power for sure.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **N/A:** Again, he has no intention of using magic.

#### Ashley Knox

The eldest child, the so-called **Stylish Witch of the West**. She is an expert with heavy firearms, as well as having excellent skills in alchemy and spellcasting. In addition, she can do all this while still looking as beautiful and stylish as ever.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **2x "Witch's Bride" Shotgun:** Once part of the personal collection of a former witch hunter, these two happily married lever-action shotguns have been rebranded by **Ashley** herself. Not that the owner would mind, as he's long since dead and buried... By her own hand. The shells fed into each of them are charged with potent fire and ice magic.
 - **Garrett M84 "Patriarch":** The all-popular beefy .50 OMG sniper rifle that everyone loves. Even the sound of it being fired is enough to strike fear in the enemy. Part of **Ashley**'s personal collection, usually kept in a neat display case in her bedroom. It definitely has seen some action, but she makes sure to keep it in mint condition. Unlike typical commercial models, this one has been modified for left-handed use.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **Crimson Shard:** Puncturing shards of red gemstone with a poisonous effect.
 - **Zalya's Fire:** A form of wild pyromancy that not many can truly master. Call forth acidic flames that burn up targets from the inside.
 - **Cryotic Blast:** A basic cryomantic spell, but don't let that deceive you. **Ashley** has perfected her understanding of its potential to a point where she can easily unleash a deadly blast of gelid air capable of freezing targets in a wide range.
 - **Dark Edge:** Dark magic is generally unpopular due to its difficulty, and the potential detriments to one's perception by the public. This despite the fact it is one of the purest forms of spellcasting, and even one that the very deity that created magic is most fond of. A thin jet of cutting force that is said to practically split atoms in half. On impact, rather than actually cutting targets, it appears to cause a release of scalding plasma wherever it touches.
 - **Pale Wrath:** Unleashes a concentrated pulse of incandescent plasma, mowing down everything on its path.

#### Viola Knox

The youngest child, and self-proclaimed **Witch of Cats**. Master of summoning, her endless armies of fierce felines can trash even the mightiest foes in a matter of seconds. Her rather unorthodox clothing in addition allows her not just to have amplified spellcasting, but also grants great mobility.

**Starting Weapons:**

 - **Z4 Casalli:** A supposedly cursed revolver. **Viola**'s skills with incantation allow her to imbue bullets with a soul-seeking capability, letting them steer towards nearby foes.

**Starting Spells:**

 - **Umbral Spear:** Summons a piercing spear of darkness that impales targets with extreme prejudice.
 - **Umbral Catalyst:** Summons bombs of darkness that blast targets to bits in a wide area.
 - **Umbral Cloak:** Summons a mantle of darkness that saps life and mana from targets.
 - **Umbral Stampede:** Calls forth a swarm of spectral cats, which will claw and bite targets to death.
